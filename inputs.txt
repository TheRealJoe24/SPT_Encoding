NOTES:
Intro Tokens ~> Empirical Data Sequences

00B1 ~> Intro Token signifying data from two propellor sources (left and right). Represented by a set of two three digit percentages (000 -> 100) for 0% to 100%. 
  Formatting [Percentage for Propellor Left] [Percentage for Propellor Right]

0001 ~> Intro Token signifying data from a water temperature sensor in degrees (F or C)
  Format[2 digit number + Letter(c or f)]


A0B8 ~> Intro Token signifying data from a single left motor. Represented by a single 3 digit percentage where 050 represents 50 percent.  
  Formatting [Percentage for Left Motor]

A0B9 ~> Intro Token signifying data from a single right motor. Represented by a single 3 digit percentage where 050 represents 50 percent.  
  Formatting [Percentage for Right Motor]

A65F ~> Intro Token signyifying data from speedometer in the seahunter
  Format [int] ~ (speed)kn

AB41 ~> Intro Token signifying if a light button has been pressed.
  Format [int] ~> boolean signal can be 0 or 1


89C0 ~> Intro Token signifying a string signal to whether the enemy sea hunter has been hit.
